# Customer-Organizer

### MERN Stack

The goal of the application is to turn the time-consuming paper
work into an interactive web application. The application allows easy
booking and management of saved appointments of garage's
customers through a planning system. Allows the client to write
down what is being done with the car when it is in the garage. It also
contains an archive so that the client can quickly check after time
when the car comes again, what work was done on the previous visit.
